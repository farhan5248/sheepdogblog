These are episodes from [podcasts I listen to](/sheepdogblog/books/) where people share information relevant to the transformation journey of my QA team.
None of these podcasts talk about QA (or even software development for that matter) explicitly but I thought it'd be useful to add some notes so that you have more examples of principles and their application.
