These are selected episodes from podcasts where people share insights relevant to the QA team transformation journey described in [Deming Driven Testing][1]. While these podcasts don't explicitly discuss QA or software development, they demonstrate principles and real-world applications that align with my approach to transforming inspection-based QA teams.

Each episode includes detailed notes connecting the content to QA transformation challenges, practical implementation strategies, and lessons learned from real-world applications.
